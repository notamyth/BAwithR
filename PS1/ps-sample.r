## Interpretations
# 1a    Every $1000 increase in total compensation for teachers is 
#       with a 4.769 percentage point increase in the math pass 
#       rate for 10th graders controlling for enrollment.
# 1b    Every 100% increase in enrollment is associated with a 1.148 
#       percentage point decrease in the math pass rate for 10th 
#       graders controlling for total teacher compensation.
# 1c    Every $1000 increase in total compensation for teachers is 
#       associated with a 2.615 percentage point increase in the 
#       science pass rate for 11th graders controlling for enrollment.
# 1d    Every  100% increase in enrollment is associated with a 0.3433 
#       percentage point increase in the science pass rate for 11th 
#       graders controlling for total teacher compensation.
# 1e    For a school with no funding for teachers and having only 1 
#       student enrolled, the model predicts a 36.61 percentage pass 
#       rate for the science exam for 11th graders.
